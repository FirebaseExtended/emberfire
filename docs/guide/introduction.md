# What is EmberFire?

EmberFire is the officially supported adapter for using Firebase with Ember Data, a library developed and maintained by the Ember Core Team for managing model data in your Ember apps. It is designed to be agnostic to the underlying backend used in your app.

Using our Firebase adapter, all of your models stored in Ember Data will automatically be synchronized with our remote Firebase database.

This guide assumes you are familiar with the basics of Ember and Ember Data.
