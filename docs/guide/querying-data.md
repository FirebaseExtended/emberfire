# Querying Data

In our posts template, let's say we want to display the ten most recent blog posts. We can do this with by adding the following parameter to our posts route:

```js
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    return this.store.query('post', ref => ref.orderBy('publishedAt', 'desc').limit(10));
  }
});
```

The second argument of the query method allows for modification of the assumed Firestore reference, [learn more about what query options are available in the Firestore documentation.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#simple_queries)

# Getting realtime updates to our queries

Use the `RealtimeRouteMixin` to get updates to records in your query while your route is in view.

```js
import { RealtimeRouteMixin } from 'emberfire/services/realtime-listener';

export default Route.extend(RealtimeRouteMixin, {
  model: function() {
    return this.store.query('post', ref => ref.orderBy('publishedAt', 'desc').limit(10));
  }
});
```
