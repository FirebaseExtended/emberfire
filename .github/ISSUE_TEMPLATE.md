Have a usage question?
=======================
We get lots of those and we love helping you, but GitHub is not the best place for them. Issues
which just ask about usage will be closed. Here are some resources to get help:

- Start with the quickstart: https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/ember/quickstart.html
- Go through the tutorial: https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/ember/guide.html
- Read the full API reference: https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/ember/api.html
- See the example app: https://github.com/firebase/emberfire/tree/master/tests/dummy

If our docs and examples don't help, you can reach us through one of the following channels:

- Ask a question with the #firebase and #emberfire tags on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=emberfire,firebase
- Start a new thread on the Firebase Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/firebase-talk
- Join the Firebase Slack community: https://firebase-community.slack.com

**Please avoid double posting across multiple channels!**
